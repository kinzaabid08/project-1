# Chapter 2: Building Blocks of Intelligent Robots

This chapter demystifies the core components—both hardware and software—that make up an intelligent robot.

## Key Ideas
-   **Sensors**: The robot's senses (vision, touch, proprioception).
-   **Actuators**: The muscles of the machine (motors, servos, hydraulics).
-   **Control Systems**: The nervous system connecting sensing to action.
-   **Software Stack**: How algorithms for perception, planning, and control work together.

## Learning Outcome
You will understand the fundamental hardware and software building blocks of a robot and how they integrate to enable intelligent behavior.
